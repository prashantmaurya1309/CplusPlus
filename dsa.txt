Data Structures is one of the most fundamental subject in Computer Science & in-depth understanding
of this topic is very important especially when you are into development/programming domain where
you build efficient software systems & applications.
Definition – 
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format
that enables efficient access and modification.
In Simple Words –
Data Structure is a way in which data is stored on a computer.

Why do we need Data Structures ?
Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer
so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
1. Each Data Structure allows data to be stored in specific manner.
2. Data Structure allows efficient data search and retrieval.
3. Specific Data structures are decided to work for specific problems.
4. It allows to manage large amount of data such as large databases and indexing services 
such as hash table.

Abstract Data Types are entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have
 implementation details.
ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms,
 data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of computer languages.


ALGORITHM-->
Dictionary Definition : A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other 
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
Formal Definition : An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific
 order to perform specific task.
Algorithms typically have the following characteristics –
1. Inputs : 0 or more input values.
2. Outputs : 1 or more than 1 output.
3. Unambiguity : clear and simple instructions.
4. Finiteness : Limited number of instructions.
5. Effectiveness : Each instruction has an impact on the overall process.

Here is an example of an Algorithm in Programming - 
Write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by user. –
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum. 
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.(sum←num1+num2 )
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop
