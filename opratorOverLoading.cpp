// We will overload the addition (+) binary operator in the program example. 

// C++ Operator Overloading - 

// C++ allows you to specify more than one definition for an operator in the same scope, which is called operator overloading.
// You can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators available in C++
// It is a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to give user defined meaning to it.
// Almost any operator can be overloaded in C++. However there are few operator which can not be overloaded. Operator that are not overloaded are follows-
// scope operator  (::)
// sizeof
// member selector –(.)
// member pointer selector – (*)
// ternary operator – (?:)
